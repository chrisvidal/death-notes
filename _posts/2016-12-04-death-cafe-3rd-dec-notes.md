Before going into the notes, allow me to share the before the death cafe event.

Yesterday 3rd December of 2016 was happening our Xmas camp with our martial (he)art school [Kali Majapahit](http://www.kali-majapahit.com){:target="_blank"}.

We spend half of the day at the Garden By The Bays training in different martial arts with beautiful people and kids. Look at this awesomeness!

After few hours of TaiChi, WingChun, Silat and knife self-defence some of us moved to Orchard Road to give free hugs to Singaporeans. About 600+ hugs were shared and spread out during 2 hours. So much love indeed!

No need to say how much our heart (dear friends and I) were open  and imbued with love before this death cafe event.

This was my second time attending a death cafe session. I guess the reason why i came back is that somewhere in me i am hoping to be able to facilitate future death cafe sessions.

Now the notes about the beautiful and flowing session organised by [The Still Space](https://thestillspace.org/what-we-do/workshops-and-events/death-cafe/){:target="_blank"}.

The sessions are totally agenda less, what comes up is pure flowing expression coming from the participants.

There we go:
- we all have this feeling that dying well is living well. But then what is living well ? This question is always coming back again and again, and seems to be central in our life when consciousness of your own death arises.
- living well have definitely something to do with prioritising your time and choose consciously how to spend it
- all the religious traditions offer death teachings and theories. But even if you might think being ready for dying according to your own tradition or culture, your physicality answer might be totally different during/before the  ultimate moment
- death offer us so many teachings. Even if you manage to prepare yourself for your own death, how do you prepare for your loved ones disappearance ? This second task seems really insurmountable sometimes.
- meditation practice definitely helps us to handle more consciously the subject of death
- why the unseen world and the unknown world are disappearing from our modern cultures ? This two "ancient worlds" were once very present in our human communities.
- why not imagining our dead loved ones being still around us in some sort of invisible force and presence ?
- according to the law of Nature, children are supposed to die after their parent. Therefore, the disappearance of our own parent s has something terrifying for the children implying ineluctably that their are next
- creating a group support in Singapore

Last but not least, this inspiring sharing strikes me the most during the session:

Consciously discussing with your parents about their death is probably the most beautiful inspiring way to bring more love and intimacy in a family.

Talking with them about the inevitable yet unknown moment of death will dissolve hidden fears, will bring love and enlightenment and will ease everyone's heart until the final moment.

Don't miss the chance to address all this questions beforehand: the pragmatic ones (will, undertaker, cremation/burying, music....), the scariest ones, the hidden ones will open the doors of Peace and Love in your family so that everybody is well prepared when time comes for your loved ones.

With Love,
