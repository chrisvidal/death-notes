### Impermanence

One my teacher way to teach to the impermanence concept is to remind us that when we are not inside a life disaster moment, we are just between two life disaster moments.

The first understanding is that life is a constant flow of  unpredictable moments. You don’t know what is coming and you only know what you are into at the present moment.
The deeper understanding would be to deeply acknowledge and surrender to the first one so that we find in the present moment the very source of an (our) happier life.

So now, applying the concept of impermanence on death and our daily life would give us the following different situations:
- you will be dying in maybe few weeks or few months,
- you know someone in your entourage who is going to die soon,
- you know someone who just died recently,
- if you are not in one of the three previous categories, you are just in the middle of one of them.

As a very dear person to me was sharing with me this afternoon, death will ineluctably bring up emotions and regrets, whichever of the previous situations we are in.
But make no mistakes here. We can be prepared as much as we can be, and still emotions and regrets will arise from our mind. I guess this is our human nature.
But it does not mean that we don’t have to be prepared or to be questioning the cycle of life and death. I mean, isn’t it part of the fundamental questions that any of us should be asking ourselves and discussing with others: Who am i ? What am doing here on earth ? What is the meaning of life ?

To quickly summarise our life situation, we all know that we are gonna die but we don’t acknowledge it and we are acting like it will not happen.
One of the reason of this behaviour can be find in the extension of our lifespan over the last century.
“It’s ok, i will have time to think about it when i’m retired” we usually try to convince ourselves. Well, if you get to retire yes maybe.
And how many of us have lost a grand-parent, a father, a mother, a brother, a sister, a son, a daughter, someone really close to us ?
Really we can’t hide like i did try for so many years neither we can’t escape from the future of this situation.

So, i’m just inviting you to think about death, and see for yourself what comes to mind in the first place.
For me, it was the total helplessness felt in front of the dying. I didn’t know what to say or to do with the family or the dying or the doctors or the nurse or my friends when they asked questions. Because i though i can do something, because i though i have to do something. I just learned 17 years after that the only thing we can do is to be here, to be present with the persons and acknowledge the situation.
> There is no greater act for others than acknowledging and being here with the person.

For you, it might be totally something else that comes up, let it come up and explore it gently.
Try this:
- find a comfortable sitting position in a quiet place
- close your eyes and bring your attention inward
- quickly check your entire body and notice any tension
- relax this tensions during the expiration
- bring to mind the word “death”
- don’t try to think, just invite the word in
- and observe what is coming up with in your body, in your heart and in your mind
- open your eyes, stay still for few more seconds looking at the experience
- you can write down whatever came up

***Death could be our best (spiritual) teacher***
