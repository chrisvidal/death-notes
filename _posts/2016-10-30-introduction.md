During winter 1999-2000, I came face to face with death.

I was not prepared at all to assist a dying person, my father-in-law.

This journey lasted about eight months. Long weeks of suffering, long hours of waiting and hoping, such a powerless feeling embraced all of us, guilt showed its face and sadness was everywhere. I was 36.

Many of us will probably recognise themselves in this common story. 

Meeting death during our lifetime is unavoidable. No need to lie to ourselves, this is a certainty.

After this tragic event, life went on. Three months later, just to amplify the situation, my wife and I divorced and I lost my job due to the internet crash in 2000.

To cope with all of this, I unconsciously buried the death of my father in law deep, deep inside. I decided to avoid facing this challenge, pretending to myself that it never happened. 

Yes quite a good strategy; I’m still surprised how easy it was to ignore and bury it all. And it worked very, very well actually…

Until 17 years later when I received an unexpected invitation from death. In fact, the invitation came twice in early 2016.

A young student of mine (I’m also a Filipino martial art teacher) who had been living an unhealthy life for years started to have serious health issues, so serious that it could have been fatal.

He is now safe and was healed by living a much healthier lifestyle and totally changing the way he looked at life. As an aside, the impact of changing our way of looking at things is really tremendous.

However, seeing him at the hospital, lying on his bed, so desperate and clinging to life, immediately transported me to the past. Suddenly, continuous waves of emotion surged and collapsed on me, in my chest, day after day, pushing me to my limit so that I could no longer keep ignoring the events of the past... 

I had no choice but to face what had happened with my father-in-law with all my vulnerability and strength. I was all alone at first. Who could I talk to about this, right? Anyway, I was barely able to formulate my emotions or articulate any questions. 

After few months, a Dharma sister was organising a [event](https://thestillspace.org/what-we-do/workshops-and-events/death-cafe/) death cafe event following the concept of [creator](http://deathcafe.com/). This is a kind of meeting where people come together to talk about their own death experiences in a totally open, secular, judgment free environment.

I immediately jumped in with my story and found so much peace by talking about my experiences. Verbalising questions, expressing hidden emotions, listening to others sharing, really integrating the fact that death is for everyone down here opened the doors of my heart.

So much work to be done and yet talking about it was so relieving, freeing and a deep opening experience. 

This is how this blog took birth, this precious joy of an inner journey based on the waves of sufferings, and a sense of the joy which gleams above all this apparent chaos.

***If you could give yourself a gift this year, it would be talking about death openly and kindly with someone.***
