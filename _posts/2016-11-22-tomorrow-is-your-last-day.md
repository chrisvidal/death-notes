> You have only 24 hours to live on Earth

This words still resonate in my ears...Some tears and fear immediately invades all my being.

That’s what I felt last year, at mid December. It was just a dream, but sometimes dreams can be premonitory or just a message coming from elsewhere and that we can’t really explain.

A little phrase that can change all the perceptions in your daily life and the way to live it.

I have 24 hours to say goodbye to the people I love. That’s what came first to my mind.

So earlier in the morning, I called my family who lives at 5000 km from me and told them how much I love them. I wanted to tell those words at the end of our discussion because that is the most important part i wanted them to remember from me.

> LOVE is everything.

Then i tried to keep my Saturday routine. While going to the local market, I observed all the little details from the streets that I was passing through, the faces I meet for the first and last time...
Melancholic, I came back home and worried about my personal things. My family members are not speaking english, so I wrote my last will and testament in French on a paper explaining who will get the little amount of things I have, and also all the administrative papers to do (bank, closing my mobile phone contract, etc.). Little details which can facilitate a little bit the transition for my relatives. I did not call or see any of my friends this day, i just wrote few emails to some of them although I loved them very much. Seeing them already very often i felt more like spending the rest of the day doing things i love to do: hiking in the forest, playing some music, praying for forgiveness to people I could have hurt during my life. I needed to feel light, very light...

And then I made myself a promise. If tomorrow I am still alive, I will buy a flight ticket to see my family for Christmas. And that’s what happened.

Sometimes, we need little wake up call like that (even it sounds a bit crazy), to go through life tests or accidents which take us close to death and eventually realise that our life is truly a gift, a huge gift that we should live the best way it only exists: the present moment. Everything slows down, the eyes move slowly devouring each detail of a painting, the smells are staying easily in the nostrils, feeling the wind caressing the skin the way it never did before, and breathe, take a deep breathe and say THANK YOU!

24 hours, 1440 minutes and 86400 seconds. Not one more.

And you, what will you do if tomorrow was your last day ?
