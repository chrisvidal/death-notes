How many of us have lost a brother, a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, someone really close to us ?

We know this relationships does not last forever. And yet, we don't really put all our care into it.
If we had a much better care of it and even if the person does pass, we know that we have enjoyed every moment because we cared all the way along.

Even thoug death is part of our life, we are living lke it does not.
Who dares talking about it ? Why is it such a taboo subject ? What are the related latent emotions ?
What can we do when we are facing our own death or someone's else very dear to us ? And how to be with someone who is grieving ? How to be with someone who's chance of leaving are at the highest ?
Death is inextricably link to life. We are born trough a breathe in and we will die with a breathe out. There is no other way around.

Who doesn't
We take life for granted, we take our partner for granted, we take our kids for granted, we take granted so much for everything that we forget to take care for it, to nurture it
In all major spirituality traditions, the Death is a central theme. Learning about *dying well* is the highest possible teaching on how to learn to *live well*.
