How many of us have lost a brohter, a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, someone really close to us ?
We know this realtionships does not last forever. And yet, we don't really put all our care in it.
If we had a much better care of it and even if the person does pass, we know that we have enjoy every moment because we cared all the way along.
Who doesn't
We take life for granted, we take our partner for granted, we take our kids for granted, we take granted so much for everything that we forget to take care for it, to nurture it
In all major spirituality traditions, the Death is a central theme. Learning about *dying well* is the highest possible teaching on how to learn to *live well*.
