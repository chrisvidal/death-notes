During winter 1999-2000, i was not prepared at all to assist a dying person, my father in law. It lasted about 8 months. Long weeks of suffering, long hours of waiting and hoping, such a powerless feeling was embracing all of us, guilt was popping in, sadness all over the place. I was 36.

Many of us will probably recognise themselves in this common story after all.
Meeting death during our lifetime is ineluctable. No need to lie to ourselves, this one is really for certain.

After the events (*Note to self: find something better*), life is going on, and during the three months after, just to amplify the existing situation, my wife and i divorced and i loose my job for economical reason at that time (Internet crash in 2000).

To cope with all of this, i unconsciously buried the death of my father in law, deep deep inside. I decided to avoid facing this challenges, pretexting to myself that it never happened.
Yes quite good strategy. I’m still surprised how easy it was to ignore and burry this.
It worked very very well actually…
Until recently when i received an unexpected invitation with death recently, 17 years later, 2 times in the early 2016. A young student of mine (i’m also a filipino martial art teacher) living a poor healthy life for years started to have serious health issue, serious complication that could be fatal. He is now safe, freed himself by living a much more healthy lifestyle and totally change the way he look at life now. The powerful impact of changing our way to look at things is really tremendous.
Seeing him at the hospital lying on his bed, so desperate and so clinging to life, immediately transported me in the past. Suddenly continuous waves of emotions were collapsing on me, on my chest, days after days, pushing me to my limits so that i could not keep ignoring anymore the past events.

I just had to face it with all my vulnerabilities and strength, alone at start. Because with who can i talk to about this, right? I was barely able to formulate my emotions or articulate any questions.

After few months, a Dharma sister was organising an [event](https://thestillspace.org/what-we-do/workshops-and-events/death-cafe/), a death cafe event following the concept from the [creator](http://deathcafe.com/). A meeting where people meet freely and can talk about their own death experiences, totally open, secular, judgment free. I immediately ran into it and find so much peace by talking about my experiences. Verbalising questions, expressing hidden emotions, listening to others sharing, really integrating the fact that death is for everyone down here opened the doors of my heart.
So much work to be done and yet talking about it was so relieving, freeing and a deep opening experience.

To continue this inner work, i’m started this blog, hoping to attend or organise perhaps some death cafe event in the future.

***If you could give yourself a gift this year, it would be talking about death openly and kindly with someone.***
