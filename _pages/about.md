>Dying well is living well

Death Notes is about bringing awareness about the subject of death. It is about openly talking about death before it is too late, it is about acknowledging our own death so that we can  bring more happiness into our own life and more care in other people life but also it is about discovering meaning to our life.
I strongly believe that death does not have to be painful and that we can learn so much from it.

Hi, my name is Christophe and i decided to start this blog to create an open space on the theme of death.

I'm not a professional working on death in any kind of manner,  i'm not a doctor nor a psychiatrist nor a psychologist. Iâ€™m just trying to question my journey trough life and was brought to face death at some point in my life.
My intention is double, deepen my inner work and understanding and share it, discuss it with the world.

This blog lives to **talk**, **share** and **educate** people around the central theme of **death**.

Thanks to a collective of people who are writing those articles, the blog is willing to transmit a diversity of sensibility about the subject.

This blog is willing to be secular even though some spirituality  ideas could arise from some articles since all spiritual traditions cohere on addressing the subject on a deep level. It would be quite a loss if we were denying their teachings.

***And they all agree that dying well is living well.***
