Hi, my name is Christophe and i decided to start this blog to create an open space on the theme of death.

This blog lives to **talk**, **share** and **educate** people around the central theme of **death**.

Thanks to a collective of people who are writing those articles, the blog is willing to transmit a diversity of sensibility about the subject.

This blog is willing to be secular even though some spirituality  ideas could arise from some articles since all spiritual traditions cohere on addressing the subject on a deep level. It would be quite a loss if we were denying their teachings.

***And they all agree that dying well is living well.***

Getting started with the [introduction article](/introduction) followed by the *getting started* article (coming soon).
