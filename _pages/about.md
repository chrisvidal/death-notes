This blog lives to **talk**, **share** and **educate** people around the central theme of **death**.

Thanks to a collective of people who are writing those articles, the blog is willing to transmit a diversity of sensibility about this sensitive subject.

This blog is willing to be secular even though some spirituality could arise from some articles since all spiritual traditions cohere on addressing the subject.

*A resource page will be coming soon with public talks, books and who knows...*
