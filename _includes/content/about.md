>Dying well is living well

Death Notes is about bringing awareness to the subject of death.

It is about openly talking about death before it is too late;

It is about acknowledging our own death so that we can bring more happiness into our lives and more care towards other people’s lives.

It is also about discovering the meaning of our lives.

I strongly believe that death does not have to be painful and that we can learn so much from it.


Hi, I am Christophe and I decided to start this blog to create an open space to talk about death.

I'm not a professional working in the area of death; I'm not a doctor nor a psychiatrist nor a psychologist. I’m just trying to explore my journey through life, a journey that has included having to face death at one point.

So, my intention is two-fold: to deepen my inner work and understanding, and to share and discuss this with the world.

This blog has been created then to **talk about**, **share** and **explore ** the theme of **death**.

Thanks to a collective of people who are writing these articles, the blog will also present diverse ideas about this seemingly scary subject.

The approach will be secular, even though spiritual ideas may appear in some of the articles since all spiritual traditions address death on a deep level. It would be quite a loss if we were to deny their teachings completely.
